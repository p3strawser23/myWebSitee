<h1>Desmond Doss</h1>

</p>
</p>
<p> Desmond Doss was working at a shipyard in virginia at the start of WW2. Despite being able to be defered he joined the military. He went to Fort Jackson were he was demoted on several occassians due to his consience objection to killing or shooting a gun. He became a medic after many arguements and went to go serve in the 77th infantry. They were in the pacific fighting the japanese. During the famous battle of Okinawa he saved over 60 lives earning him the medal of honour.
</p>
<p>I choose Desmond Doss as my hero because i think what he did and who he was were true acts of courage and heroism. I have always looked up to military figures as my dad, my uncle, and my grandpa have all been in the military.
I love to watch history and war movies to truely understand the struggles of the past and how the actions of the many and the few shaped how we live today. One of my favorite movies was acually about him. The movie was called Hacksaw Ridge.
It showed the famous battle of Okinawa against the japanese military. What is so famous about this battle is how during the span of three days Desmond Doss saved over 70 soldiers from both sides, without a weapon, never touching a gun once. He survived the ordeal and won the medal of honour for bravory.
I have always seen the medal of honour as a method of pointing out greatness in this unfair and harsh world.
